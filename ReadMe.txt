Welcome to my Covid-19 project!

The dataset was downloaded on the CDC website and contained all the recorded Covid-19 information available to date. 
The dataset was cleaned in Excel and split into two files. One file contained the Covid-19 deaths and the applicable columns, while the other one contained Covid-19 vaccination rates.
Both datasets were transferred to Microsoft SQL Server.
The queries deployed looked at:
  Total cases vs. total deaths.
  Total cases, deaths, death percentage, and population of each country.
  Total cases, percent of population infected in the United States.
  Countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
  Countries with the highest death count per population
  Continents with the highest death count per population
  The rolling count of people vaccinated and how the deaths were affected by it. This required me to join both tables and use a CTE
  
 Finally, the results of these queries were downloaded and transferred to Tableau for visualization.
